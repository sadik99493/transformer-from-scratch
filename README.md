This repository contains the code for my open-source project on transformers. I have created a transformer library that anybody can use to create their custom
transformer with just a single line of code. Simply import 'build' from 'model.py' and instantiate it with your specifications. 
The library also includes a tokenizer that you can use to pre-process your text.
These 2 videos have helped me greatly in creating this project :
